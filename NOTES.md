# Notes

___

### Pricing:
I think we say $300/hr
[See table](https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-top-management-consulting-firms-charge-clients-per-consultant
) on billable hours near bottom of 1st answer


### Who Does What
We all do whatever we can to get this going asap, but I
think we all curate and work together on finding the right services to offer and
agree on the layout (JP will build the site).
Perhaps Marc can design the adwords, think of a useful cost and other ways of getting our name out there.
Maybe there are tenders we can do. I have a corporation that we can use to bill.


### Things to be done
- Figure out how we bill (I guess it depends where our customers are).
- Find some templates/ strategies online for the output of the work done.
- Just find some clients (secure some contracts). 

### Services on offer:

Writing this as a first pass, it seems silly, but hopefully I will iterate and improve it.

Business Analysis:
    - Business Process Modelling
    - Analytics (PowerBI and Tableau)
    - I am sure there are many things here:
        optimization
        process mapping
        uncovering insights
    - (I think we should add basic web business services like websites, email marketing, and seo)

Energy Consulting:
    - Develop a cost saving initiative (energy audit)
    - Options for renewables


Web Application Development
    - Choosing the right stack for your needs

Mechanical Engineering Design:
    - Drawings for home projects
    - Designs for modifications
    - Solution development for any home/ small office projects?

Future Technology:
    - Drones for video footage
    - Oculus VR benefits for the workforce (new applications being developed)
